# Python-API-Challenge
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. In this challenge, we set to answer the fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator; Plots created to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude; linear regression computed for each relationship.

Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable,  weather data skills are used to plan future vacations.
